<h1 align="center"> Project Overview </h1>
This project aims to build different NLP models for sentiment analysis and classify depression in tweets with the goal of forecasting the frequency of these from before and after the Covid-19 outbreak. This will both test the knowledge of different NLP methods and analyze the performance of these using naive bench-marking as well as implementing these in the new problem of sentiment analysis. Furthermore, this project will also contribute to the research of the social implications and impact on mental health due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
