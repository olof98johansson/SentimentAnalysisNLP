gustav mahler was so worried about the curse that he tried to cheat it by not numbering his actual th symphony and then naming his th symphony his th he died shortly thereafter 
while beethoven is the most famous victim of the curse it has also claimed dvo k schubert and bruckner among others 
 between the filler and the celebrity deaths i think we could be on hbo 
 funfact the curse of the ninth is a superstition connected with the history of classical music in essence it is the belief that a ninth symphony is destined to be a composer s last i e that the composer will die while or after writing it or before completing a tenth
