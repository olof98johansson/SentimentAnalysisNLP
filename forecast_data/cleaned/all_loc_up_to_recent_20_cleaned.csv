ross comes home to find rachel drunkenly sobbing on the couch honey what s wrong he asks emily in paris she sobs no emily s in london and she means nothing to me why are you bringing her up now 
she decides not to mention it to ross because any time she does he accuses her of guilt tripping him she opens another bottle of merlot 
the more she watches the more pissed off she gets with ross that could ve been me she sighs i could have gorgeous bilingual children and a hot french husband why the hell did i come back from paris 
and if they re not in boise idaho they re in its european equivalent she always feels stupid at them anyway so has given up going she only intends to watch one episode of emily in paris but she binges the whole series 
 this looks interesting she thinks and opens a bottle of merlot the twins are away for the weekend and she has the house to herself not having been to paris in the intervening years she doesn t realise it s utter nonsense alas most of ross s conferences are in the us 
it s rachel geller is reflecting on her years of marriage to ross her career stagnated when she got pregnant with the twins and she has always played nd fiddle to some damn fossil she s at home while ross is at a conference she spots emily in paris on netflix 
he did say he would leave it up to the court s trump will have his hands full for years and years if he can hold out that long but at the end of the day his criminal life will catch up on him
