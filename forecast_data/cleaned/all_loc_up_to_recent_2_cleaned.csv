neither the uk nor wales are in france or germany or spain but those flags are still flying on the sea front at aberystwyth this is because there is a display of neighboring flags so why remove the eu flag from among them who exactly are we trying to attract here 
i ve had a communication from the tourism amp marketing manager of to say that the eu flag has not been included in this year s display following the departure of the united kingdom from the european union i don t see the logic of this at all aberystwyth
