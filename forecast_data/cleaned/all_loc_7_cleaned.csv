 it doesn t but what it does effect is the families who dont know where their loved ones remains are or the families who have had innocent children killed or the families who dont know the truth about their children s disappearances a bit of sensitivity please 
any other theories maybe they re just good old reanimated nazi corpses who didn t quite finish c st society integration training at bannon s school of world domination hard to tell frankly if only we could sweep them all out to sea on a mighty flood of righteous nausea end
or is it that bad faith performative rebelliousness they love to enact which i assume has wider appeal reaching out as it does to the more discerning ie less self aware racists among us who doesn t love a bit of plausibly deniable race hate from a loveable rogue eh rant
so is it simply that a large enough proportion of the population are full on racists and playing to them gives the tories a big enough electoral minority to keep their sweaty hands on the levers of power rant
it s possible they just lap up pseudoscience like it s something vintage they liberated from daddy s cellar cummings certainly loves a bit of it but that doesn t seem the real reason they re too narcissistically in love with their own sense of strategic brilliance rant
this vile racist shittery obviously has no justification on the other hand the overprivileged wall spaffers at no clearly think it does and it feels important to try to understand why rant no racism shittery andrewsabisky

if you want to know the science about eugenics and why it s total crap then there s no better place to start than who is amazing at explaining this for theologians go to 
that s how left field unscientific far out ideas take hold challenge them with the righteous indignation of facts science belief and history throwing a fit is easy we all do it being right takes effort and often a long twitter thread 
 love and hugs my friend 
read tweet again and repeat engage deeply read widely and don t let those who would deliberately have you engage in what is designed to make you froth and foam if you re not ready or willing to look at some much deeper issues 
what s far more worrying is that we re happy today to ignore proper political discourse when the bonkers distraction of loony ideas appears long form is jettisoned in favour of characters or more real debate is about more than how many likes or followers we get 
 thanks i ve been there once so be twice tomorrow be glad to not have em any more 
source material is important go back and read what someone has actually said newspapers don t always accurately report that though more often than not they do but do the legwork understand the issues don t just pontificate unless you have then go for it 
the question here surely is are we are all honest about that do we say one thing in public and another in private do we take to social media to flag our views when in reality we think something quite different behind closed doors

i don t know andrew sabisky bc i cannot possibly defend what is reported that he has said or believes i don t agree with him in a thousand ways on his view of liturgy to those who know me that ll hardly be a surprise 
such nonsense needs to be called out that s right but if we all looked at our timelines and asked would i agree now with what i said five ten or twenty years ago well many of us would probably say no 
society has some real issues to deal with and then there is social media froth they are not the same i know there are repugnant ideas peddled here half truths and pseudoscience given credence by those who want to clutch at straws 
ok eugenics is wrong racism is wrong profiling is wrong statements about the poor especially from those who probably haven t lived that life is profoundly ignorant but so is some commentary and some extraordinarily tendacious extrapolations i ve seen today
