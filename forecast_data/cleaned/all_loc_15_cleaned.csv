i can confirm that i do not have twitter notifications on no one asked i just felt like saying it
 that would be the sensible approach why would she suggest that 
if they don t get a grip and should they allow both big and small businesses to collapse while our continental neighbours save their companies this contraction of the economy will not be short term and will instead become a depression that will last for many years 
it s a horrible phrase bailout these are loans not charity the government talks a good game around the support packages put in place now they need to deliver not just for virgin but also the thousands of companies like mine applying for covid loans 
it s a loan that will be paid back over time not a handout and it s down to exceptional circumstances virgin brought much needed competition to the aviation sector they deserve to survive competitors like easyjet have already been bailed out 
 that s why even if i don t subscribe to its political worldview i have for some time taken the irish times worth it for fintan o toole s writing if nothing else 
i don t see the problem with asking for a gov loan for it seems fair enough virgin pays taxes in the u k and their employees pay tax and buy things
