 two idiotic comments i am not surprised at neale richmond but martin that is beneath you 
regards mr mark o g anderson baker 
suffered from the pandemic coronavirus covid all people like you are driven by greed but your stupidity attitude towards people is coming to a disgraceful end that goes for the people above unless you change your attitude and greediness watch this space kindest 
greedy obese person that you are peter cowgill what is it with you not getting enough food care before your guts i am naming and shaming you are amongst them your not important enough a sad case for a human person maybe just maybe you will loose out like others who have 
false facts irresponsible person that you are i might even stop watching the fiona bruce show peter cowgill executive chairman j d sports you are nothing more than a pathetic prat like the politicians upper classes and the wealthiest money money money me me me me 
and shamed okay or you step down simple fight fire with fire your knees are staying of our necks for good your easy lifes are over bbc broadcasting corporation fake news again the proper amount of deaths fiona bruce is over okay get it right and stop giving out 
mp another racist crocodile tears on television interview michael gove mp another racist doctor liam fox mp another racist and i will continue to name and shame all politicians upper classes and the wealthiest and will not stop until every single one of you are named 
secretary under thersa may basically sacked i am going to make your life hell they say that the truth always hurts and has a habit of coming back and biting you in the ass news flash foreign secretary dominic raab mp another racist home secretary priti patel 
house the prime minister boris johnson mp is the leader of the racists so how does a racist stop racism simple you do not the politicians need to be removed named and shamed and boris johnson mp i have plenty of your dirty little secrets shamed in the post of foreign 
wealthiest are aware of this and just want your money they do not care what happens to you because they have your money think about your children families friends this will keep you level headed hopefully news flash for got to say the head of the racists the parliament 
forgotten this temperature checks are a false positive it can take up to days or more before your temperatures start affecting you and remember this you start to shedding the coronavirus covid the day it enters your body and the politicians upper classes and the 
chief executive conservative home problem is you are part of the problem you are not medically trained so do not make stupid remarks it makes a big difference between one metre and two metres you pathetic snob shut your mouth piece for the politicians people you have 
 the european reactions are quite funny
temperature checks are false positive that under cover agent in russia got caught when you do a job like his you know the risk involved that is fact and he got caught with his pants down if you are not willing to do the time then dont do the crime simple mark wallace
