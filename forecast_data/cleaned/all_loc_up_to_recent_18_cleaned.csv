eddie kingston may have bitched whined complained disdaining his disillusionment efforts to think he can love amp respect jon moxley but realizing that he deserves just as much as him to headline a pay preview in aew turn into second full gear 
 
can you draw a question mark on the magicwall for all your irish fans elections 
 it was
and now the story is that jon mosley is a pro wrestler amp the in alone he became the champ at aewrevolution amp grabbed success everywhere amp anywhere he is the longest reigning aewworldchampion amp currently the longest champ in the whole company 
tony khan given eddie his opportunity on september rd where few years earlier he had announced his retirement due to opportunities not going his way until they do years later he met moxley again years later aewdynamite and he did not tap 
beef rib cooked in the oven for five hours it s melt in your mouth kinda goodness very simple and yet very yummy sunny southsea seafront 
eddie kingston the og never beat moxley in a match it wasn t settled it only started until today started at allout never got eliminated from the rd ever casino battle royale he went underneath the middle rope amp counted as a redeemed factor to mox 
 he s doing the best he can for all the right reasons i can understand why people are alarmed but his heart is in the right place 
farage has trumpitis please quarantine him for good 
 asostreatme asos got you asosgotme 
people will say if he has been around the pro wrestling business for nearly decades did he ever meet or faced jon moxley answer s yes amp yep amp one time in where he was one of mox s last opponents before the entertainment industry called him 
 i ll leave the key under the mat
 what a show btw shotzi the perfect host as well
the highlight of his career for while is his polarizing run in with impact wrestling part of the dcc which isn t no wrstling to him amp he had friends everywhere else as to him are family real family but yeah he knows fellow aew talent aka santana ortiz amp diamant 
maiti well and truly thrown under the by he of course done no wrong 
here s his absolute intense wrestling highlights which is most famous for having his family plus at aiw epic th anniversary he even wrestled jessica havok

 he is also accused of gumming up the postal service during his tenure so the votes arriving late are also on him i don t know if that s true but the idea that only democrats post votes is beyond me 
 ditto some of them were blatant about it after they had voted felt forced to drop off one elderly woman at a bus stop half a mile in the opposite direction after she had revealed her true colours

 they re protections given when the statisticians at the networks calculate the leader can t be caught only once in recent history have they got it wrong they gave florida to gore in then reversed it so you can be confident they re not going to change

 there is a case for scrutiny of this appalling election i ve never seen anything like it accepting ballots without postage dates non matching signatures and delaying the results constantly with no valid reason that is what i can a sham 
i m speaking it into existence i m manifesting it that tomorrow morning i will wake up to see the words presidentbiden all over the internet 
 michigan is definitely up for a recount and nevada is only like k votes in favour of biden he s still got a shot here

 i don t think anyone would complain or have an issue with that 
 
 
 that s my thoughts too i think biden is less likely to demand the nhs the way trump was

even if biden wins it should never have been this close after all the carnage the man has caused trump should have been chucked out on his ear with ease there is still something rotten at the core of the united states and it stinks of bigotry hatred and ignorance

this is based off the fact that arizona and nevada will go democrat and alaska georgia north carolina and pennsylvania will go republican
 but not tuna amp gherkin sarnies 
just a thought if trump refuses to leave the white house leave him there let it be a purposeless building then cut off the power and water he s probably used that technique himself dumptrump
 i m not american amp in the past even attended a gop convention as a foreign observer my objection to trump is a characterological one of dissembling not a partisan one as i don t belong to any us party i just want the leader of the free world to be a decent person of integrity

 it does because votes in any democracy physical or digital are grouped together in bundles for each candidate so all the biden votes are in one bundle together and all the trump votes in another bundle together they don t all get added at the same time

 omg joking about about your time in italy is really sick want about the family members off the murder victims it isnt a joking matter life sentences the family members are doing so have some respect and grow up sorry but you no im wright
 
all we seem to be hearing from trump is noise he is seeing i d he can shout the loudest by claiming states even the one mi he actually lost ideally needs to win georgia and nevada and not just limp over the line
 indeed eric every month without fail 
to all those who told me trump would win these current odds suggest you were wrong 
 hes definitely got the better end of the deal

republican in the house 
 he s actually so significant for me musically i remember watching him when i was very young and being captivated by the music and the visuals numan bowie blondie but numan to quote another band i love first and last and always he is the main reason i m a music nut 
 it s completely down to a lack of organisation of course which is on ogs but this transcends a poor structure to transition to defence it s not a full back too high or a cm vacating their space it s a fucking striker as the last man in his own half 
 so he moved from arguing against apartheid then evolving to advocating for the the mass incarceration of black men 
 they ain t that good 
 the meltdown has started according to sources close to trump claimed after seeing projecting a biden win in arizona he phoned murdoch to get fox to retract rupert refused to intervene

 i am watching your cnn analysis live from scotland in the uk john thank you for your expertise and the simply way you explain the us electorate process in layman terms and your summary of the vote progress is a credit to you and cnn
 hours of watching cnn it was a real struggle to turn off time to go to sleep and see biden s victory in the morning

the onus is on us to listen and build a more empathetic inclusive and equitable world elections equality inclusion lgbtq blacklivesmatter heforshe
 i don t think they should be allowed to stay in office until the next election they re obviously not fit to run the country 
what we need is greater empathy across all divides more dialogue more shifting of ground and ultimately more growth for all the alternative is unthinkable 
as says let s not treat our opponents as our enemies cc 
 will you be doing your lock down vids on you tube still
addressing their concerns is not a zero sum game with addressing the inequities faced by the deeply marginalised disenfranchised vulnerable and excluded and indeed we cannot adequately serve the most marginalised and vulnerable in our society if it continues to be so divided
great way for sauchie to bounce back from saturday s late collapse 
 that means we have some soul searching to do middle america and middle england are voting because they have suffered decades of under investment and neglect from mainstream politicians 
that means that those of us who do not stand for the politics of hate and demagoguery whether we think of ourselves as liberal or left or call ourselves by or align ourselves with any other name or philosophy and frankly i don t believe these old labels work any more 
trump may go away brexit and farage may go away bolsonaro and orb n may go away but what they have tapped into will not all the data shows that deep powerful long lasting change cannot be achieved without shifting this polarisation and addressing its causes 
yeah
full time results from our championship games tonight hear reaction from the managers on the breakfast show tomorrow morning cr sport is back saturday with luke from pm 
the last thing we should do now no matter who wins is to just pretend as if the past four years were an anomaly they were not if we don t grapple with this then we are setting up the world our successors will inherit to be even more deeply divided and unequal 
i do not believe that a full of the u s electorate is racist or that of the uk voters who voted to leave the eu are xenophobic note i said voted for the politics of not motivated by hate bigotry and fear 
the brexit referendum the u s presidential election the uk general election what s happening right now across europe south america shows us that global society is deeply polarised and divided 
 i agree if he does loose he ll be throwing the toys out of the pram 
these people have come out and voted in even greater numbers than in something has motivated them it s easy to think that this motivation is hatred or ignorance or apathy and you may believe that but the reality must be much more complex 
these numbers will not simply go away but they are also not just numbers they are people they are people with agency who want to have their voices heard you can call them names you can sneer you can pretend they do not exist but they do 
but we cannot and must not ignore the fact that over million people and nearly of the electorate will also have voted for the politics of hate bigotry and fear 
 
in the biggest electoral turnout in u s history over million people will have voted for an african american south asian woman vp candidate 
 definitely not
 surprisingly not 
but no matter what happens this will have been very very close indeed in absolute numbers more than the electoral college or the presidential result the senate race is deeply telling and a robust barometer 
we are in the final furlong now and i do believe hope and based on the numbers think that and will clinch this decisively both in terms of electoral college and popular votes 
 really sorry to hear this lizzie didn t get a chance to know you but followed the great work you were doing thoughts with you your future is very bright 
what does this mean for our quest to build a more inclusive fairer and more equitable world a thread cc and spurred amongst others by tweets from with

 very likely right but one imagines it was intended as an academic exercise and the press has simply got overexcited about it 
 it s alright glenn counting every last vote just means it is going to be a democrat whose blasting you in the ass rather than a republican blasting you in the ass but a better democrat than the awful freedom hating hilary clinton 
on entirely different note are we in favour of good strong beers or weak beers 
 that is great news thank you for letting us know
