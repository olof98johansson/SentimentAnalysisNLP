does anybody believe that if trump loses the election he will respect the result any more than he respects the right to protest america has a dictator dark days ahead 
imagine a country had nationwide protests there were multiple instances of media being arrested for reporting on it that country s president had tweeted about firing on protestors and was deploying military on home soil for the first time in years what would we think 
 you re 
 are you for real while trump was spinning his rhetoric peaceful protestors were removed through violent methods from the front of the white house an absolute insult to democracy by a looney tyrant 
a truly noble act well done

is protest the answer 
trump declaring he is an ally of all peaceful protesters whilst tear gas and explosions literally surround the white house 
mentions the second amendment right with purpose and advises he will be using an insurrection law to quieten those who dared to stand up to his vision on america whilst also then saying america always wins inflammatory rhetoric in a made for tv moment sickening
