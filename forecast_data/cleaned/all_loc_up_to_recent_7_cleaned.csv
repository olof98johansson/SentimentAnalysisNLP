to be honest if britain invaded it we probably took a perfectly good country and fucked it up including pretty much most of africa asia and the middle east but all you ll hear is how wonderful being part of the british empire was for those countries

to be honest this is pretty much the case with any colonial era history taught by white english speaking nations archaeologist there s no way they could have done this without modern tools therefore i ll make up some bullshit about slaves or advanced civilisations
