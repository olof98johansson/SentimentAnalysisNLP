 your not ugly though you ve got beauty both inner and outer don t listen to the haters

nothing against dominic raab but i thought rishi being the chancellor would be the stand in for boris i m not sure how it works
 around the world the consultants doctors nurses support staff community care pay them the respect they deserve as nurses we do not do it for the money consultants doctors nurses support staff community care do not do it for the money we do it because we 
so yeah i get why i m not busy at work but it s still such a weird thing to get used to 
 get a hold of yourselves and stop being selfish stupid idiots do the right thing by your children families friends colleagues and the national health services community care they are close to breaking point they put there lives on the line for all of us 
and obvs our company falls down on major facts in this whole situation we are a transport company and obvs we ve not to travel we are a transport company for vulnerable disabled people who have to stay home we are a transport company for elderly people who have to stay home
 supposed to be the greatest privilege in a adults life it is time for you to grow up your children must be thinking what are you doing to us i know what they would say to you that they are ashamed of you if you was to ask them what they think its time to 
 them because it is fact that taking risks you do not if you did you would not be so selfish and stupid taking some thing like the coronavirus covid into your homes end up infecting every single person child in your homes if you have children they are 
 i knew bless him 
 proud of doing you need to sit up how am going to get through to you nobody is immune to the coronavirus covid if you want to know this you the people who are taking the risk you need to tell your children families friends colleagues you do not care about 
 so sorry to hear that bro things will come around love to you and yours from ireland

 medical advisers that it would affect the people with underlying health conditions the rest would get mild infections children babies years old i stated they were wrong not just our conservatives government but all governments around the world and 
 and now it has happened again it has jumped from human to animal i have not spent the last weeks warning you here in the united kingdom and around the world this virus is like nothing that has happened before you was told by the people and the rest of the 
 he s so articulate that s why foreign leaders are so impressed by him 
 underestimated like the named above professor john ashton tried to warn everyone what was going to hit the world i looked up that night and was told that something happened where a virus now known as the coronavirus covid had jumped from animal to human 
 around the world will you please tell what you just do not get the coronavirus covid is not seen unlike bacteria you can see what it is doing to the body its has always been that viruses are the unseen enemy the prime minister boris johnson 
 people are not taking the coronavirus covid seriously you are fools like the prime minister boris johnson health secretary matt hancock professor chris whitty professor stephen powis professor newton and the conservatives government and the governments 
 please read this all now people are you going to believe what i told you from weeks ago professor john ashton and myself have been telling you that you never ever underestimate a the coronavirus covid i was told that when i started my training yet 
wtf is that

also should say for weeks was unconvinced that we had the virus but have changed my mind because of combination of symptoms contact with others who were ill and professional opinions of medic friends obviously not tested if you re poorly stay positive and trust the nhs 
bottom line mild for us really was super mild only a tad worrying the nhs service was available and calming the poor doc had me blubbing incoherent thank yous to her for everything my gp was available by phone and sensible nhs staff are this country s backbone 
drake baby moms saying rell thing 
 
the difference between our experience was that a fit young kid was bouncing around after just over a week i have taken a full month to feel normalish and am still coughing with a tight chest considered whether i might have had colds back to back but seems unlikely
headache but no high temperature degree difference at most however common a high temperature is it s not the only symptom to look out for our daughter was grey faced confused and not making any sense i was close to taking her to hospital at that point 
bad chest pain whether this was muscle pain from the coughing or lung inflammation who knows nobody listened to my chest still have pain on one side of my back feels like a lung pain now tight chest but dry cough and not much gunk coming up daughter had bad chest pain 
i m used to fatigue managing iron overload but this was near total exhaustion a few lost days of sleep and not much else except a few tweets low appetite sleeping hours straight tired after doing nothing daughter slept days and ate nothing she lost lbs 
 gogogo 
 
feeling nauseous and just ugh off for weeks for those of you who have been through the first trimester of pregnancy that kind of ugh god i feel sick but i haven t thrown up feeling sick but not sick daughter felt very nauseous too not often mentioned as a symptom 
slight moments of panic unable to catch breath at these points i did things used my salbutamol inhaler to relieve tightness and tried to relax remembering childhood whooping cough used breathe through nose and try not to panic technique taught by my mum that helped 
coughing and coughing and coughing for weeks badly then for almost three more weeks slowly slowly getting less coughing so that ribs and back hurt and loath to take a deep breath because it would set off more coughing tight tight chest and feeling throat constricted 
should paedophiles be forced to carry bowls of hot soup in public making it harder for them to chase children 
 
i completely relate to the description of coughing your guts up until you feel sick many times i hovered near the bathroom because i was sure the cough and nausea was going to result in my being sick but it never did 
 i ve known him over years and i have never heard him say that

everyone is thinking of and his family getwellsoon boris you are in safe hands nhs we look forward to seeing you back soon 
our sincere thoughts for our prime minister wishing him speedy recovery 
 you are getting hysterical i believe the where s boris thingie was some time ago i think most normal people accept that he has been self isolating recently and is now hospitalised stop politicising these unfortunate events 
this corbynista journalist shouldn t be employed by a mainstream newspaper again typical of the nastiness and blind inhumanity which infiltrated our party in thankfully we are changing direction and hope and other outlets will be more wary of voices they amplify 
 happybirthdayannemarie happy birthday you ve helped me grow and appreciate myself more then you ll ever know forever thankful for you i love you and i hope you have some mallibuuuu or wkd 
 pretty sure americans are praying for their own health and well being right now and it s a shame trump can t appear to show the same sympathy for his own people that he does for one liar cheat charlatan boris johnson
