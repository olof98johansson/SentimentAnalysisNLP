that proves that if parkinson is given a pre season to bring his own players in and get us properly prepared we have a very good chance of promotion i just don t understand how people can t see this safc
the fact is wether it was ross parkinson or any other manager that bad run happens difference between ross amp parkinson is that parkinson had a solution and when fitness was sorted out we won out of which is the same win percentage that coventry had in 
parkinson inherited a completely unfit team in the winter period we played games in his first days in charge there was no chance to improve fitness and when you have less fitness than your opponents ability becomes secondary
in terms of the team was completely unfit ross was lucky that at the start of the season you usually get a full weeks break between games if he didn t have had them results would have been far worse
 the msm need to put this out it s time now the people have had enough there are families losing livelihoods here this shambles is causing more deaths than the actual virus disgraceful
this myth that we were playing great under ross then parkinson comes in and we suddenly start playing crap is so laughable we were playing awful football and scraping undeserved wins for the majority of ross s reign
once again listening to people are they people banging on about refugees risking their lives to come here none of them desperate none from war zones estimated refugees we are talking about a fraction you heartless bastards
