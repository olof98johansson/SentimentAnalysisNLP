 he looks really pleased with the new box you bought him 
 and once maradona has scored more than goals and won world cups we can also discuss whether he was better than pele
 pretty blooming amazing 
 i remember it well 
 
 fb is a cesspit i went cold turkey in never looked back 
 
it would be far easier if he asked for help he would find the drink much quicker 
me too 
same just about my poor nose is so itchy like hours later 
 i dont think thats happening yet 
 
a question for the older football experts was it a travesty that maradona wasnt included in the squad or he wasnt yet good enough they won it anyway so the end justifies the means but always wondered 
 no pls you re already too powerful for us all as it is
 what colour are they meant to be sorry lol

 you think so drivers only kill around people a year as a result of their decision to drive at excessive speed perfectly acceptable to focus on the more serious problem of being delayed for a few seconds by a couple of cyclists riding abreast then the key point still stands
