mixed bag of a showing first half great second not great but what a result another huge over and done it and three points in the back with a host of quality players to return 
and one of my favourite wrestlers in the entire world who didn t do anything on nxt jumped to impactwrestling and became the knockouts champion that was one mistake nxt definitely made but they don t constantly make them so it is sometimes easy to forgive 
 he s getting worse by the day he is a disgrace
 
i really hope some day soon tripleh takes full control over the he has proven with wwenxt that he is the right man for the job and he knows how to build a superstar obviously even has made some mistakes with wrestlers but not as many as the main roster
 thanks 
on wwenxt a lot of wrestlingfans do get annoyed with the treatment nxt wrestler s get on the main roster so hopefully going forward things change and when wrestlers get caught up they are actually given an opportunity but i have my doubts 
already since his return he has felt like a big deal and a bigger deal than he ever was on the main roster with the exception of winning the universal championship for one day due to injury of course then of course you have wrestlers like embermoon who has became a big star
whyyyy it s very confusing 
 i really didn t think would bring us miche l martin seeking to relitigate the bailout hardly a good talking point for ff but i guess nothing should surprise us this year 
people like tommasociampa johnnygargano candicelerae rhearipley i really hope this treatment on the main roster doesn t happen to them because they re way too talented to be put through that and in a way i m glad finnbalor went back to wwenxt
and that s no disrespect to themiz and johnmorrison but for someone as strong and quick as keithlee he should not have lost he should be on a winning streak at this point i think after nxt they should go to another promotion 
but with the exception of defeating randyorton in his first pay per view match he hasn t really done anything else after that and he deserves so much more first you take his epic theme song away and then do nothing with the guy and he should not have lost to miz and morrison
and literally nothing happens with them it doesn t happen to every single person but more than not you do feel bad for people like mattriddle not only got his first name taken away but looks like a goofball now then keithlee who should be an absolute wrecking ball a monster
 i would very much like to see the various species around the world in the wild i think the dalmatian pelicans at lake kerkini in greece would be the first trip very lucky we have these great white pelicans in the park though 
i am a massive fan of wwenxt every wednesday night and i m a massive fan of their takeovers but you do get concerned when an nxt wrestler gets caught up by to the main roster because there is a massive curse that fantastic wrestlers go to the main roster

to have elements of fun attached when we peruse streets in our own made costumes i hope to see and build in our designs becoming the norm challenge when challenge is needed tweak if a tweak is essential try to show that fashion is art you look at art in museum but what we as
they believed in us and helped us to take a leap forward but from day of trying to do as we had written i felt a backlash and push back alexander mcqueen will always be remembered as such an amazing visionary who pushed boundaries this was a q i asked myself to the board 
i can t stand beautiful ones by suede due to a toxic boyfriend who loved them
i would love to go back to my initial days in setting up curious although i feel that those days are well and truly past for months the prince s trust made me meticulously do the sums cost fabrics float ideas of clothing prices and all very favourably too on retail costs
i like to challenge our understandings and hopefully make a leap forward in understanding with folk such as those who did surround me made me see my vision could be possible then a financial clash now a covid recession and i have a feeling brexit recession and tariffs 
reminder that we did have great visionary ideas we worked as a team and complimented each others designs when i look back and think of what may have been could have been amp possibly almost came to pass it gives me shivers i know the ways in which i see things can offend society
 so gut wrenchin 
things took a funny turn when juan decided out the blue that new york was now his new calling i ve heard from him a handful of times and must say sincerely i really do wish him the best but when i think of what could have been amp where i am now its stark depressing and an
absolutely brilliant 
interior design business i even enrolled in courses and all to try and move all these ideas along i was i was artistic but in truth cpuldnt draw so relayed my designs sometimes to juan john i wanted to start out with this k from princes trust and over time expand

firmin a who 
 are you feet tall 
inside i was watching something that i d grown from a seed working with a dyslexic boyfriend who coudlt do the writing or numbers but i could amp approached outside pvt sources to see if i was indeed right to pursue our original ecstasy fueled weekend sessions curious could 
off design we had soooo much for to offer reading back my business plan that ultimately got us our funding st time without any hitch proved to me what we had been doing and saying thus far was working yes it may be slow going and just a few haute culture a season 
choice we would sit down and design haute cotoure off designs with a hefty price tag with lesser hedonistic designs to make the client give us a brief and possible insight to their own lives and ambitions for me to much time was being spent with individuals who wanted a 
which would cascade out the newly open surprise and somewhat curiosity would be spiked i d had initially hoped i d perhaps have a dozen or max highly made up and standing out women bringing more ppl to their cause to see exactly what curious is that ultimately is your
the apple would be heavily polished and have stuck to it the store business card address possible prizes for those who visited st but the apple would have the business card stuck to it and wrapped in muslin tied with a golden bow upon opening there would he gold confetti
and victorian dress walking around the city centre shopping streets with baskets full of bright red apples the apple would be wrapped in semi see through muslin just walking around handing out these free food items as a psych report at the time showed ppl would accept food
mouth made open up in the centre of the shop at the front door yet the snake would drop the apple the apple would be pur till our money safe seems quite fitting i think but to raise said curiosity i planned to have the admin team all dressed upon over the top elizabethan
situated at salt market i in my biz plan had wanted to set the male side of the store as adam and the female as eve painted on the walls ceilings and floor with uv activated paint that would have made our shop glow in the night andbstanding along in doing so i wanted a snake
monday night raw
why curious you ask well it can be of things a queation or a statement and our fashions w are to push to boundaries of that aforementioned curiosity there was a possibility of premises inside the italian centre next door to bersave and hugo boss or a larger shop
that business plan written over a month period was and in my eyes still is the most amazing thing i have ever achieved buying machines sorted a premises sorted our initial and quite crazy idea loved by all who heard it i must ass here we decided to name our biz curious 
 i acheived that task today i was two coat hangers short so have two items lurking but the vast mountain of clothes are in my cupboard and wardrobe where they live 
confidence i ll be honest when i read our finished business plan back i was flabbergasted truly john juan my partner took care of designed and i d sometimes chime in and sometimes it worked worked and others didnt but this business plan i have no reservation in saying that
before writing down in my own words what they subject is trying to convey ppl talk of long covid and brain fog i look at works i typed up over my past yrs from princes trust application that we got max funding for finding the perfect shop to set up in i was filled with
to me that would be a fail my mind is in overdrive reading paragraphs and trying to write out a simplified version that could be expanded on i was unwell for almost weeks i think its be safe to say delerium set in i study a paragraph for mins and then have a min break
drove out to today to buy some of the books that i ve earmarked to buy over a lovely independentbookshop and we re just a few in the basket also ordered from amp booksforchristmas 
books that were for the actual course i should have been on i admit i took day pit to try forget all i d studied for near weeks but ultimately had days to study for research and grapple my new course suffice to say having days rather than weeks left me with 
 caralho meno podia dormir sem essa mas assim eu concordo com ela se eu tenho condi es de ter pq n o mas fds n o tomei esse fora de gra a
i hate writing such tweets but been told can be cathartic i endeavoured on my ou course a cpl months back and have handed in my st assessments for weeks i was booked on wrong course so ultimately had days to forget all i had studied the past month and open up new

the amount of stress we get over christmas is bad enough but add covid wankers to christmas wankers and sprinkle in all your regulars who haven t been able to go their local for the past six weeks that just don t seem to get that there s a pandemic going on in the first place

but not the whole of west yorkshire just leeds so people flood to the city from nearby towns for christmas catch ups and brunch dates and shopping and family visits blah blah blah because you can do it here it s tier two like tier two is working soo fucking well elsewhere
