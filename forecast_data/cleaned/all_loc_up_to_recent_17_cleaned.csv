 continued this is where we calculate the cost of project if all equity financed then work out tax benefits and then add them together adjusted present value or in this case value of company 
 continued then work out weighted average cost of capital using acquirer s debt equity and cost of debt and the newly calculated cost of equity as above now discount using this discount rate this would be the adjusted present value method
 unchanged cost of capital due to no change in business and gearing risk change in business risk we d have to do the following calc asset beta ungeared equity beta of target company gear it up using acquiring company debt equity calculate cost of equity using capm
when calculating cash flows of a company these need to be discounted but what discount to use methods 
although other factors affect this such as synergies goodwill etc
calculating value of company a couple of main methods assets cashflows price earnings method all have their limitations assets at book value all sorts of problems there replacement value probably max buyer should pay or net realisable value minimum a buyer should pay

it s incumbent on to put the structures in place to make this new department work amp it s up to the cllrs to back them in order to deliver these projects sounds easy right 
we ve got a real opportunity in front of us to make long lasting positive change the financial backing amp policy direction from government around active travel will be crucial in helping us get there cllrs brave enough to take the right decisions will achieve this change 
 i ve backed a few card games here and there currently waiting on a backpack and a designer figure kickstarter wise
others no doubt people will be asked to make other changes also the key in delivering this new much needed amp safer infra for people on bikes and walking will be the councillors standing up for what s right even when those shouting loudest seem to be the only voices 
people in many instances being asked to forego some of the convenience of their existing car journey to accommodate safe infrastructure for vulnerable road users this may take the form of new one way systems in certain areas or full closure of streets to vehicular traffic in
too often we hear local politicians say i m all for x but and the end result is a project getting watered down to a point that it serves nobody or else just shelved this can t be allowed continue to happen as projects under this new department start to develop we ll see
fingal will have two great allies at cabinet in eamon ryan amp as we move to make the necessary changes to provide a top class active travel network in the county it is going to be up to cllrs of all parties amp none to give their full backing to these efforts 
people with us in making the necessary changes to the public road network however we ve seen with many projects over the years that even positive change will be met with resistance often this leads to the people who shout the loudest getting the result they want no change 
is delivered we don t have the space to just keep adding more amp more cars to our road network most of our towns amp villages are already choked with traffic this will only worsen if we continue on the path that we ve taken to date community engagement will be key in bringing
departmental structure due to sheer volume of competing demands eca amp at dept will need a clear brief amp a strong mandate to deliver their projects the nta is challenging fingal to deliver kms of new cycling infra over the next years it s crucial that this and far more
watching towneley hall on youtube made me laugh in the cella iv missed watching you all good catch and stu with the cradle rocking and the responses from the spirits x
as always the devil will be in the detail there s no point creating this new department if it s not backed up by the resources to deliver quickly amp effectively allocation of staff in terms of numbers amp skillsets will be critical too many projects get lost in the current
 donated there sorry i can t do more 
and other activities the norm for our young people instilling this behaviour at a young age will pay dividends in terms of health fitness environment and general use of public space for years to come how do we get there in the context of this new department in fingal co co 
is there no end up his talents he s modest too 
cycling become the norm for the majority of fingal s people too many kids are being driven short distances to school or other activities because it s deemed not safe for them to walk or cycle we need the infrastructure to make active travel to school
active travel a safe amp convenient option has seen people make the choice to walk or cycle in their droves if you build it they will come i ve no doubt that is the person that can drive a much needed transformation of fingal s infrastructure so that walking amp 
faces fingal amp most other local authorities we need an ambitious amp deliverable plan that will allow people to choose more sustainable methods of getting from a to b with particular focus on safe routes to school amp linking the towns amp villages of fingal everywhere that has made
