pretty embarrassing for michaelrice he didn t deserve that should have been half way up why with eurovision they obviously hate us 
 it did ok with the judges and ok with the public many other top songs either got amazing scores from one or the other not both 
 well done don t take any notice of the thee remainers they excell at being all inclusive and caring unless you happen to have a different opinion then they are intolerant and rude 
i m something years old and i still can t understand how some people don t cover their whole bathroom in water when they wash their face 
 u didn t deserve to be last tonight u did so well 
 time to leave it eurovision
 very true hopefully they won t be putting up with us for much longer

 to be fair our song this year was pretty hopeless i suspected bottom place was coming for the uk not getting the dreaded null points was maybe the surprise 
it s so funny seeing kate silverton really giving the top news headline treatment to man city when she used to do breakfast news and it was sports bulletin time you could sense she hated football bbcnews

 exactly philip just goes to show the rest of europe has no taste in music whatsoever we come last and bloody iceland get more points than us 
he would ve won earlier had he not had the fake piano still a surprise winner but in the spirit of eurovision and reality tv no one will care on tuesday nowcot production rocked though 
 well done uk to michael from us all xxx
 you cant blame everyone for the actions of a few
 nobody else asked the question i m very happy to see city called to task for any indiscretion pep however isn t the target aim it at those who run the club
i feel so sorry for the incredible the scoring was so unfair on him his performance was outstanding well the best judges definitely ones last year who crowned him their winner 
next year i will boycott eurovision as a protest against the mild cheeses that will inevitably be involved 
honestly this full moon has messed everyone up including me and i ve just about had enough

 my eyes are a glow with well done all especially for making the awards 
 ah ok my source has been informed 
 yes but punishing a crap song because of brexit is v funny wait for nige farrige to use this on campaign trail
 i ve just tweeted that yes 
someone tell the brexit party that we can leave the eurovision song contest without leaving the eu
and that is why europe can do one eurovision
well that should have been our song a losing game eurovision
 nope teams have won trophies without many teams more worthy than this purchased man coty team 
i agree
are you okay 
 netherlands were one of my top s congrats but i did want italy to win can t believe uk came last again only points from the public s europe hates us eurovision
 this is a matter of national pride and they will have to claw it out of our cold dead hands 
 it really was i m so happy for him and you guys 
nice try madonna but i do it better than you eurovision eyepatch meningiomawarrior winkwink 
and next year everyone wears orange
 thanks for that i was hoping someone had captured the highlight of the evening 
enjoyed the preakness more than the derby warofwill
 wasn t nil points though every cloud right serious burn for germany 
 
loving you is a losing game but for the netherlands that song surely isn t a losing game esc 
 everyone who muted eurovision has still had to cope with your euorvision updates 
rather stick pins in my eyes than watch eurovision
 apparently socialist champagne is all that bit sweeter

 loool you fully sold him a dream poor guy he was upset 
 fkin rubbish
 not saying we were the worst by any means just saying the reluctance to spend any money or effort on the staging is mostly to blame for its placing i d have traded in a worse song for a bit more glitter and gimmick or two it s eurovision for goodness sake 
hahaha there s europe s reaction to brexit in the public vote for you only points says it all really eurovision now to keep farage out of being an mep please gb voters 
why sweden why eurovisionrtve eurovision 
 that is why they are discriminated against

 hmmm i d been mixing up the hordes with finishing up the story lines so maybe you have to get to a certain of hordes cleared before the mission pops 
oh well until next year uk will finally do it again look how long it took the netherlands to get the victory once again after years
 gaan we doen kom maar logeren 
ha ganado la canci n de la pausa para mear eurovision
 
 hope there isn t a next time for uk save our money
 was just thinking this hahaha
 bastards in play betting was mental sweden north macedonia were available at when they were first and second before public vote how does that work 
the points given to the uk for eurovision is more than those given to leave europe 
 putting it on the back would still do the job i think collectors that display them would probably prefer that too and it still wouldn t be mistaken for an original 
also australia was robbed eurovision eurovision 
she ll be calling for a people s vote next
 well done michael in our eyes you were up there with the best of them 
i love this

 it was worth the watch to see that swedish guys face at the end 
 dunno like this seems like crop of shit

 the curse if brexit eurovision
 agreed 
and that s it for another year off to netherlands we go eurovision 
the summary of this year s eurovision europeans discover the reggaeton and almost make italy win because of it generic songs still win over the unique and original ones something is for sure the uk won t be missed if the leave the eu or at least from eurovision 
 phenomenal result genuinely delighted to see your monumental efforts reap such a significant reward thankyou
 italy were my favourites out of the top although north macedonia winning would ve been hilarious everyone scrambling to book flights to skopje like it s the europa league final 
gutted sweden didn t win 
only pure love for iceland after they held up free palestine banners and still came tenth respect for them and there political balls to say fu to the system is inspiring hatari eurovision

i dont like it not sure why this won 
 same as the juries but they add them all up and award them in a lump if anyone could be bothered they could put the total available into a calculator subtract each country as they went along and know whether the last one announced had any chance at all as far as i can tell
