excellent piece on the uk s obsession with poverty porn by much if our media how feeds division and deflects from the billions lost by tax evasion and other loopholes 
just be careful out there these people are evil and desperate they will stop at nothing to achieve their despicable agenda of misandry and men hating watch these people and avoid them people who can defend false rape allegations can descend as low as possible for anything 
these retarded nitwits have their own brand of feminism which is like a cult and political party they only have one clear manifesto hate men destroy men nothing else and any man woman who says or does anything outside of that manifesto must be attacked and ostracised 
if you are still under the illusion that the attacks against that young law student was just a random thing you are naive there s an agenda to ruin men there s an agenda to destroy men and ruin men s careers there s an agenda to use any means even lies just to wreck men 
i hope you know one of those fools was who last year falsely accused of raping her an accusation that he only escaped simply because he kept the chats this sensational idiot is part of those attacking a woman for speaking against false rape accusations
