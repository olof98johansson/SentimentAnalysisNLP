 why s that pinocchio 
 i am a trained pastry chef if people need recipes i can help its back to basics for us all lovely work you can t beat anything that is freshly cooked 
once all risks have been considered in terms of deliveries health amp safety of our teams must come first we may have to adapt sops such as ringing the bell amp leaving medicine on doorstep retreating meters amp waiting to see the patient collect the medicine 
be able to adapt our procedures to minimise patient contact others may need to make a call on an individual patient basis taking into account the level of risk involved amp involving any other hcp or team who can aid your assessment decision we may have to suspend daily supervision
 stick as you are that advice is bs in any sort of real world scenario 
for instalments prescriptions we need a risk based approach for daily weekly instalments there will be flexible regulation amp we should document decisions we make mds for some patients we may deem it necessary to issue all nomads at once for supervised methadone we may 
 ps nice throwaway i approve 
unscheduled care should be utilised by pharmacists to the fullest they are working with adtc teams to come up with pgd to allow pharmacists to supply prescription only quantities of paracetamol to those self isolating without needing a prescription 
 are you i d head back 
they realise repeat dispensing quantities have increased quite significantly sg will communicate to practices not to issue extra prescriptions they should only be providing scripts to provide medicines to cover a normal cycle of rx to protect the medicines supply chain 
they support cp teams to do only what is necessary at this time amp have agreed with scot govt to freeze cms registration activity immediately we may wish to consider whether to freeze other services other than dispensing and the mas depending on each particular circumstance 
 considering what we got for tunsil and stills last year i m not surprised
 emergency guidance for something that everyone knew about months ago

thanks to amp for clarifying that some additional or unneccesary procedures could be removed from communitypharmacy following a risk assessment firstly we can stop asking patients to sign prescription and do it ourselves to minimise risk of infection
