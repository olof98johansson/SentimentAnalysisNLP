 he said the same thing as you don t know why he does that 
whereas the aag for antitust has been all too willing to pervert antitrust law into a weapon to use against trump s enemies cnn at amp t comcast so it s not surprising that he would suddenly assert authority here whatever you think of google this move reeks of gangsterism
 its a direct attack making the army fall in line with the police who have become a tool of common purpose
the two agencies share antitrust jurisdiction and divide it by industry ftc has handled this area in the past the difference is that ftc is an independent agency with three republicans who seem to be committed to a traditional free market narrow conception of antitrust law
ftc investigated google s business practices and found no grounds for an antitrust suit it s totally fair for ftc to reconsider that decision based on new evidence but the fact that it s now the doj bringing the suit tells you everything you need to know this is political
