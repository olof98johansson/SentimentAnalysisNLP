of course yesterday s best in class silicon is tomorrow s junk and apple s a series arm cpus have long left the core line in the dust so it s only fitting that johny announces the transition away from the cpus his old team invented 
the pentium m was a complete rethink based on the older pentium iii it gave birth to the core line of cpus whose performance per watt massively outstripped the pentium and were used as the first intel cpus in macs 
the pentium m was a significant cpu for intel for years they d been losing the desktop cpu battle with amd a familiar story right now hemmed in by extremely poor thermal performance in the pentium they actually released a ghz cpu in 
it was somewhat apt having apple vp johny srouji present the news about the arm transition given his history years ago he was part of the intel r amp d team that came up with the pentium m cpu
