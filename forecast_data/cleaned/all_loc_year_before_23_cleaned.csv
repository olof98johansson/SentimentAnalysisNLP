and was definitely a deserved winner he ll come up against many more fighters who employ the dark arts amp dirty tactics amp he ll be all the better for this rough tough experience and next time he does he ll sort it out quicker amp knock his opponent spark out mot josh 
that s great news
to win a world title you have to go and earn it fight for it galahad did neither and the right man won yes it was scrappy amp definitely not pretty but josh will learn from it and will be better for it jw hung on amp kept his head in constant rubbing of heads orchestrated by kg 
 long definitely
 me can t see my lasting the though 
 he has much more than that he deserves some serious doctor patient time for those out dated and incorrect views

 not as much as america needs a new president 
 deffinately the advantage of fighting on home soil i did think warrington showed that he wanted it more than galahad it s got to be the states for him next

 whos house is this what a laugh you sre ivy hahaha 
 did you imagine cinemas like this 
 dreadful
daisy rock left in newport town 
 good sum up that mate just felt as a challenger galahad held on to much at crucial times amp didn t quite stand out enough to win it typical sheffield fighter good mover with his head etc
 is that eytan 
 it s hard to believe that patsy is nearly 
 out boxed at times but dont think the kid troubled the champ enough in his back yard to take the belt 
 when you pass away if just one person remembers you are you really gone you are with this person forever so your never really gone i lost my mum brother amp father they are all in my thoughts and subconscious everyday so for me there always with me in spirit
