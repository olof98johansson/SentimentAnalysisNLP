ha ha how true 
murder on the dodgems 
all said there are lots of positives steven mcnicoll puts in a commanding performance as matti amp his comedic rapport with smith is effortless mrspuntila may not always hit the high notes but it s an enjoyable night at the theatre none the less 
 welcome to oldham
gimme some truth stayseminal york 
 mrspuntila is brought together with an immense labyrinth scaffold set by tom piper lighting by katharine williams live music composition and sound design by oguz kaplangi kaplangi provides an intricate sensory experience something we rarely encounter in live theatre 
 u think urs are babes 
where it falls apart is in the direction usually one of dot theatre s strongpoints murat daltaban s direction strangles the piece elaine c smith is a master of comedy at times she feels restricted at other points the pieces meanders into the sublime the balance is wrong 
 d will u post the link of your interview on belfast girls i watched it you re such an amazing woman will u post a link to it on here for us pls tag me in it thanx xx
 is it bad that i chuckled just a little bit then 
elaine c smith leads the cast as mrs puntila in a gender reversal of brecht s original play adapted by denise mina the play largely sticks to brecht s philosophy amp social commentary sadly as relevant in as it was in the original finnish setting mrspuntila

 i had a chinese takeaway last night with very nice it was too 
 who 
super nice to have around for my weekly game night introduced her to bargain quest and railroad ink two lovely little games super close scores too with only points between all three players in both games combined 
 mrspuntila is a wealthy scottish landowner when drunk she promises the world to those less affluent than her but when sober she reneges toying with their lives under the watchful eye of her ever suffering chauffeur matti she plans to marry off her daughter eva 
moving to chester has overall been great so far but man i wish i had a job it s crazy how much you miss getting up and going to work when you don t have it that and the money 
 mrspuntilaandhermanmatti at based on brecht s classic this master and servant play is loud proud amp highly comedic in nature sadly however this anarchistic style production is neither strongly structured or improvisational enough to make it work
