i reject this withdrawal agreement i support an orderly wto exit as legislated for failing that revoke the withdrawal act amp article be warned it ll will get messy 
 hahaha so true there s no way i can deny it 
bars
i see a better option in staying in the eu for those reasons coupled fairly amp squarely with the fact that it s easier to leave the eu on the current terms than if it s under a so called withdrawal agreement 
 good for her a lot of obnoxious voices heard like that grey jumper man and his wrath of the people 
the consequences will be dire both amp will suffer heavy defeats there will be a huge anti eu sentiment this will be reflected at the ballot box a new order will prevail this will not be pretty and in the meantime we will be in the eu mixing it up 
if parliament regrets the idea of a no deal brexit then it should be brave enough to say so it needs repeal far withdrawal act amp this revoking article this will mean that we stay in the eu politicians both here amp in the eu will then need to live with the consequences
 literally the only hope right now is that bercow won t allow the third vote 
i support it as it is the only position that has been legislated for parliament made that decision along with invoking article it s a position that could work i personally didn t prefer it but we have had almost three years of talks with the eu and we have reached this wa
if we reject this deal we either leave on the th march or the th june without a formal withdrawal agreement i personally would have no problem with that as i do not view it as a no deal scenario small deals for a smooth transition have already passed european parliament
 dad mum brothers sisters and me we even had a wee dug called dixie all celtic daft a story many on here can replicate i m sure 
the essence of brexit is britain s right to do trade deals globally esp usa commonwealth china s new silk road ie make its own laws 
thread ok here s my brexit position happy to explain this in detail if you want i believe that the deal presented by amp the eu is a rubbish deal if provides the worst possible settlement terms i believe we should reject it there are two consequences to this
