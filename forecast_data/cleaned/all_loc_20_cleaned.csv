 emma it was really nice to read something emotional and vulnerable making and poignant it was great and honest of you to share 
 why can t people understand hus motivation is irrelevant it s not whether cummings did a reasonable thing but that he did something proscribed by the rules he himself helped devise the only way people like him boris and hancock appreciate their folly is by suffering from it
